The Official Definition</h2><p>At its core, the \'Paid Partnership\' label is a <strong>disclosure tool</strong>. According to the FTC (Federal Trade Commission) and other global advertising bodies, any creator must clearly and conspicuously disclose when they have a \'material connection\' to a brand they are promoting.</p><p>A \'material connection\' means you have been paid, or have been given free products <strong>in exchange for</strong> a post. This label is the platform-approved way to stay legally compliant and transparent with your audience.</p><h2 id=\'what-the-tag-means-on-each-platform\' style=\'color: #333; font-size: 1.8rem;\'>What the Tag Means on Each Platform</h2><h3 style=\'color: #26A69A; font-size: 1.5rem;\'>1. On Instagram</h3><p>When you use the Instagram Branded Content tool, it adds the <strong>\'Paid partnership with [Brand]\'</strong> label. This does two things: 1) It clearly informs your audience of the sponsorship. 2) It gives the brand partner access to the post\'s analytics and allows them to \'Promote\' the post as an ad, extending its reach.</p><h3 style=\'color: #26A69A; font-size: 1.5rem;\'>2. On TikTok</h3><p>TikTok\'s \'Paid Partnership\' toggle works similarly. When activated, it adds a label (which can say \'Paid Partnership\', \'Sponsored\', or \'Ad\') to your video. This is required for any content where you are paid to promote a product or service, and it signals to your audience that it\'s commercial content.</p><h3 style=\'color: #26A69A; font-size: 1.5rem;\'>3. On YouTube</h3><p>On YouTube, creators check a box that adds an <strong>\'Includes paid promotion\'</strong> overlay to the first few seconds of their video. This is used for brand sponsorships, paid product placements, or any other content where a brand has paid the creator.</p><h2 id=\'the-big-question-paid-partnership-vs-gifted-pr\' style=\'color: #333; font-size: 1.8rem;\'>The Big Question: \'Paid Partnership\' vs. \'Gifted PR\'</h2><p>This is the most important distinction for creators. They are not the same.</p><div style=\'background: #fff; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 1rem 0; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\'><h3 style=\'color: #333; font-size: 1.5rem;\'>\'Gifted PR\' (The Hope)</h3><p>This is when a brand sends you a product for free, with no contract and no obligation to post. They <strong>hope</strong> you\'ll love it and post about it. This is the world of <a href=\'/blog/how-to-get-pr-packages-australia\' style=\'color: #26A69A; text-decoration: none;\'>how to get free PR packages</a>. You are not required to use the \'Paid Partnership\' tag, though you should still disclose it was a gift (e.g., \'Thank you [Brand] for gifting this!\').</p></div><div style=\'background: #fff; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 1rem 0; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\'><h3 style=\'color: #333; font-size: 1.5rem;\'>\'Paid Partnership\' (The Job)</h3><p>This is a formal business transaction. A \'Paid Partnership\' means you have a <strong>contract</strong>. The brand is paying you (with money or product of high value) in exchange for a <strong>specific deliverable</strong> (e.g., 1 TikTok video, 1 Reel + 3 stories). You <strong>must</strong> use the \'Paid Partnership\' disclosure tag.
