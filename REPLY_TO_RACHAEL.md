**Subject: Re: Stripe Country Issue - Fixed!**

Hi Rachael,

Thank you for reaching out about the Stripe country issue. I apologize for the confusion!

**What happened:**
Your Stripe account was created before we implemented country selection, so it defaulted to France (our platform's base country). Unfortunately, Stripe doesn't allow changing the country on an existing account after it's been created.

**Good news - we've fixed it!**
We've just implemented a solution that detects this issue and allows you to recreate your Stripe account with the correct country. Here's how to fix it:

**How to fix it:**
1. Go to your Payments page in your creator dashboard
2. Click the "Connect Stripe" button
3. You'll see a popup explaining the country mismatch
4. Click "Recreate Account" to create a new Stripe account with your correct country
5. Complete the Stripe onboarding with your correct country information

**Important notes:**
- If you've already completed Stripe onboarding or received payments on the old account, please let me know and we can help you handle this differently
- The new account will be created with the country from your profile
- You'll need to complete the Stripe onboarding process again, but this time with the correct country

If you run into any issues or have questions, please don't hesitate to reach out!

Best regards,
