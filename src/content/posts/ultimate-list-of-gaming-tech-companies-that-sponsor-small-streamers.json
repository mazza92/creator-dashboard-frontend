    { "question": "What stats do gaming sponsors care about most?", "answer": "Beyond followers, they care most about Average Concurrent Viewers (CCV), chat engagement, and stream consistency. A streamer with 50 loyal, engaged viewers is often more valuable than one with 5,000 passive followers." },
    { "question": "What is the difference between an affiliate and a sponsorship?", "answer": "An affiliate program is commission-based; you earn a percentage when your audience makes a purchase using your link/code. A sponsorship is a direct payment (or free product) in exchange for specific promotional activities, like a dedicated video or a logo on your stream." },
    { "question": "Do I need a media kit for gaming sponsorships?", "answer": "Yes, absolutely. A professional media kit shows you are serious. It should include your stream stats, audience demographics, past successes, and a clear list of what sponsorship packages you offer." }
